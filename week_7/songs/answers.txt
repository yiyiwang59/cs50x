Taking into account their average valence, danceability, energy of someone's top 100 songs,
one can try to infer very simple auras based mostly whether a person gravitates towards more
positive, more upbeat (high valence, danceability, energy) music or
meloncholy, slower vibes (lower valence, danceability, energy).

These metrics are very hard to really pinpoint any more specific auras than on a lateral spectrum,
one metric that I would add into the evaluation is an analysis on the actual lyrics of the music
the listener is listening to. Many upbeat, danceable songs actually have quite sad lyrics, so the
overall feel of the song may not reflect that actual emotions the listener is getting from the song.
