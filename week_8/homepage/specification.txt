Javascript/Bootstrap description: I used Bootstrap for essentially the entire website, specifically the Album template for the 3 child pages, the Heros template for all 4 pages including the home page, and the Header template. I kepy the Javascript pretty simple;
On the Bojack page, the "Ruthie" card had a spoiler alert and I converted that into a button that when pressed will reveal the text containing the spoilers.
