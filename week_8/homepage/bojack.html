            <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
              <p class="lead mb-4">Bojack Horseman is a Netflix animated sitcom about a washed-up TV star who tries to navigate Hollywood and his own personal struggles. There are a total of 5 main character we follow on this show: <br>
                <ul style="text-align: left">
                    <li><b>Diane Ngyuyen</b> - A Vietnamese American writer with a tough upbringing as the scapegoat of her family, trying to turn her lonely, neglectful childhood into a meaningful life making a difference that is bigger than her. She is often the more politically-charged, morally-driven, and dynamic character in the group as she tries to navigate her personal journey with morality and depression.</li>
                    <li><b>Princess Carolyn</b> - A pink cat who grew up being the main caretaker of her household, mainly her mom. She leaves home to pursue a career becoming an agent in Hollywood. She inevitably becomes a workaholic while still trying to balance getting to important life milestones like marriage and kids without sacrificing her career. Her main struggle in the series is figuring out her personal/professional boundaries and her identity being tied so closely to her work. <br></li>
                    <li><b>Todd Sanchez</b> - A carefree, absent-minded, but caring boy who is estranged from his family and finds himself couch hopping through the series. He's probably the funniest character in the show, but he grows a lot throughout the show into learning more about himself, his sexuality, and setting boundaries on how he treated by people who don't appreciate him. (mainly Bojack) <br></li>
                    <li><b>Mr. Peanut Butter</b> - A carefree, optimistic, charismatic Labrador who is in a relationship with Diane. His story line is generally pretty light-hearted since he is primarily a goes-with-the-flow character, but he does struggle with being considerate of others and eventually has to learn about his own relationship patterns with codependency. <br></li>
                    <li><b>Bojack Horseman</b> - A narcisstic, depressed, lazy actor who grew up with extremely toxic parents that led to him having awful coping mechanisms with drugs and alcohol abuse, meaningless sex, toxic/codependent relationships, and just generally treating everyone around him horribly. We follow him through making some grave, grave mistakes and slowly, very slowly take accountability for these mistakes. Although he is an anti-hero, because we see his generational trauma and his inner thoughts, we can really empathize with the parts of him struggling which makes him overall a very compelling main character to follow.</li>
                </ul>
</p><p class="lead mb-4">
                This is not a show for the weak-hearted, there are some serious dark, depressing moments so viewer discretion is advised. But if you can get through it, you'll see what a cinematic masterpiece it is.
                This is a show I come back to whenever I'm experiencing one of my own life lows, because what this show does for me is that it shows me deeply flawed characters with struggles that I personally relate closely
                to and shows me empathy and acceptance for my own flaws navigating through my own struggles. I've never had a show that has made me feel so seen as a human while also having such ridiculously hilarious humor
                tied to it. It's by far my all-time favorite piece of art in general and I will likely keep referencing it for the rest of my life. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is the episode where Princess Carolyn had just made 3 major mistakes as Bojack's representation in the episode prior and now Bojack has made the decision to fire her. In trying to fight this decision,
                          Princess Carolyn has a fight with him arguing about all the times she stuck by him when he was being a deadbeat client. It's an episode that showcases Princess Carolyn's true struggle with not being able to separate
                          personal from professional matters and reflects on the long, codependent relationship between Bojack and Princess Carolyn. It's through this episode that we see how much Princess Carolyn really sees the good in Bojack,
                          more than anyone else in the show, more than even the audience. We see how much she really struggles to set boundaries because she genuinely cares for him and wants to help in any way she can, even at the detriment to
                          herself. Which makes it all the more sad when in the end, after all of that, Bojack still decides to fire her. A true break in this decades long relationship. It really shows just how narcissistic Bojack
                          can be, even to someone who has shown him mountains more compassion and forgiveness than he has ever deserved.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is the season 3 finale episode following an extremely painful-to-watch episode called "That's Too Much, Man!". I love this episode for 2 main reasons: the first being
                            the devastating quote Bojack gives as he's grieving a tragic death of someone dear to him: <br> <i>I don't know how to be, Diane, it doesn't get better and it doesn't get easier. I can't keep
                            lying to myself saying I'm going to change, I'm poison. I come from poison, I have poison inside of me. I destroy everything I touch, that's my legacy. I have nothing to show for
                            the life that I've lived and I have nobody in my life who's better off for having known me.</i> <br> <br> On a lighter note, the second reason is the absolutely ridiculous but hilarious sequence in the beginning that makes Mr. Peanutbutter a superhero for having an
                            absurd amount of spaghetti strainers laying around, something that was set up earlier in the season. It's hard to actually describe without the entire build-up and context,
                            but it was seriously some of the best comedic writing I've ever
                            experienced.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I love the story-telling in this episode. In present day, Bojack has ran away from LA and is now staying at the runned-down old summer house that he went to as a kid, where his mother spent her summers
                          as a kid. He meets this neighbor who's a firefly who eventually starts to help him put the house back together while simultaneously telling the story of his mother's childhood in that house across time. We learn that
                          his mother, Beatrice had an older brother, CrackerJack who fought and got killed in WWII. Beatrice's mother absolutely adored her son and was devastated by his loss. We watch as Beatrice's mother spirals out of control
                          her her grief whiel the show draws a parallel to the grief of the Firefly neighbor losing his wife. In the end, it's revealed that because of the outdated times, the solution for Beatrices's outburst was lobotomy, which
                          was devastating for Beatrice to witness as a kid. Her mother tells her: <i>Love does things to a person, terrible things. Beatrice, promise me you will never love anyone as much as I loved Crackerjack.</i> <br>And this is where
                          we as an audience come to realize that Beatrice had really internalized that lesson and it explained how awful she treated Bojack. This is one of those moments where you realize that even the most unredeemable, horrible
                           character also has their own trauma that explains their actions.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is an episode where we get a inner look at Bojack's own negative self talk. He's going about his normal day interacting with his mom, but we get to see the inner monologue all
                          the thoughts that's going on inside his head and it's noticeable that tone is full a lot of anxiety, self-depracation, and spiraling thoughts. I love this episode because it really shows
                          the reality inside someone's mind with anxiety and depression. In the end of the episode, Hollyhock, a teenage girl who was living with Bojack and trying to figure out if he's her dad, tells him
                          that she's having that same voice in her head telling her she's not good enough and she asks him if that voice ever goes away when she grows up. After watching the episode, and empathizing with
                          him, we know the answer is no, but Bojack says yes anyway to comfort her. It's a sad realization and a nostalgic one where I realized as the audience just how long that voice had been living in
                          me own head and how when I was younger, I thought that it would fade away as I grow up and sitting there years later and knowing that that voice never faded was a sad feeling. This episode
                          really made me feel seen, like my own inner world was finally being illustrated so accurately.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">This episode is about Princess Carolyn going through the worst day of her life. The episode begins as a story being told by her great great great granddaughter
                        giving a class presentation about this specific awful day she had. Throughout the episode, as more and more things go wrong, the story is being positioned to have had a happy
                        ending. That the things going wrong are all a part of an intended desired end result, the way stories are usually packaged up to be. The big reveal in the end</p>

                        the entire bit with her great great great granddaughter was never real. It was just her coping mechanism she uses to tell herself when she's experiencing rock bottom. As the audience,
                        we were set up throughout the entire episode hoping for a happy ending and instead, we were met with the devastation of realizing that the promise of a happy ending was all fake. This is one
                        of those gut-puncher episodes that feels so raw and real because that is how it feels to go through your low points. There's no certainty that it will "work out in the end", you just have to
                        face it regardless.</div></span>

                              <p class="card-text">This is the episode where Bojack gives a eulogy for his abusive, neglectful mother's funeral. The entire episode is a beautifully written and delivered raw, but comedic monologue
                                  that shows Bojack grappling with mixed emotions about the passing of his mother, looking back at memories of her and grasping at anything to point to any speck of affection she
                                  might've had for him. The monologue is so conversational that you don't even realize that the entire episode has gone by. This episode is especially painful for anyone with a complicated relationship with their parents.
                                Even though Bojack had basically non-existant mother-son relationship with his mother, her death still feels awful to him and by the end, he explains why:</p>
                              <p class="card-text"><i>Suddenly, you realize you’ll never have the good relationship you wanted, and as long as they were alive, even though you’d never admit it, part of you, the stupidest goddamn part of you, was still holding on to that chance. And you didn’t even realize it until that chance went away.</i></p>

                          of suppressing those memories. Instead, she impulsively gets inspired to write another story about a girl detective named Ivy Tran. I love the way the show illustrates this sequence because when
                          Diane is trying to write her autobiographical novel, the illustrations are jumbled and discombobulated just like her memories of it, but once she starts writing her Ivy Tran story, the illustrations
                          become colorful and full because this was where she was truly having fun and was able to put together a much more complete story and character. There's a scene in the end where Princess Carolyn tells
                          Diane that the girl detective story was really good and she should keep writing that but Diane gets frustrated because that was not her original intention. When Princess Carolyn asks why she has to write her novel,
                          Diana says <i>Because if I don’t, that means that all the damage I got isn’t good damage, it’s just damage. I have gotten nothing out of it, and all those years I was miserable was for nothing.</i> <br> <br> This touches on a feeling that felt really close to home. Often looking back on our own struggles and trauma, there's this desire to try to turn it into something net positive, perhaps by
                          sharing it to make others feel less alone, in an attempt to give those awful experiences some sort of positive value in your life, to try to make sense of why it happened. I love that what Diane
                          doesn't realize yet is that her girl detective story would have that same effect, to make others feel less alone. When she was growing up, it was wholesome shows like Horsin' Around that got her through
                          her tough times and her girl detective story could be that for people going through similar struggles.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">[TRIGGER WARNING] This is a very trippy episode that happens at the very end the series showing Bojack in some convoluted dream trance, because he was having a dear death experience. There's so much to unpack
                          in this episode that only one watch through isn't enough. There's plenty of analysis videos on youtube that point out all the details in the episode that point to different characters and events throughout
                          the series, so I recommend watching those. The three main things I loved about this episode was the dinner table discussion he was having with all the characters who had died throughout the series and they
                          were having a philosophical discussion on mortality and meaning of life and goodness and what each character brought to the discussion was very aligned to the life they lived and the nature of their death,
                          the poem that secretariat shared about his experience unaliving himself which expresses the feeling of regret after the deed had already been done, and the ending sequence where Bojack tries to escape being
                          swallowed and he has a pretend conversation with Diane in the end, accepting whatever fate was coming to him.</p>
                          <p class="card-text">The poem View From Halfway Down is one that I go back to rewatch often because of how beautifully written it is. In the show, it is known that Secretariat had un-alived himself by jumping
                             off a bridge. In the poem, he writes about his experience seeing the "view from halfway down" after he had already jumped, where the regret starts to sink in but it was too late, he had already jumped. The delivery was chilling
                            and reflective of what a lot of survivors of attempts experience, really articulating the gravity of the irreversible nature of such a decision. In my personal opinion, this was the single-handedly the most effective piece of work to persuade
                            someone against attempting. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is the final episode of the series where all the characters get a real conclusion to their story. Generally, everyone is in a healthy place, having grown throughout the season and are now
                          all individually deciding to end their relationship with Bojack, which is really for the best. So Bojack ends up having one last moment/discussion with each one and it feels very bittersweet but fair. With Todd,
                          he worries about relapsing and Todd gives him some sound reassurance. <br>Bojack: <i>What if I relapse again?</i> <br> Todd: <i>Then you'll get sober again.</i> With Princess Carolyn, he has a nice friendly conversation with her and we just get
                          to appreciate and be so happy about her conclusion. She found someone who is perfect for her, raising a kid while also balancing a successful career. And with Diane, she shares that she's married to someone who is
                          also perfect for her. Diane also shares that Bojack did actually call her when he almost died and she expressed how upset she was to be put in that position of feeling like she always had to be the one to save him.
                          We see her as the final character that has officially drawn the line and is now cutting herself off from Bojack. But not before she shares her own wisdom. <br>Bojack: <i>Life's a bitch and then you die right</i> <br> Diane: <i>Sometimes.
                          Sometimes life's a bitch and you keep living.</i> <br> They have a simple, somber, beautiful last moment together as the show concludes. It was truly the perfect, more realistic ending for everyone.
                          <br><br>
                          I loved this ending because it wasn't one where Bojack got fully redeemed and forgiven for all the horrible mistakes he's made. You see growth in him and there's a sense of hope that he'll turn things around, but he also
                          has to experience the consequences of his actions, which was losing all of the people in his life except Mr. Peanutbutter. Every character got to where they needed to be in the end but there's this human level of uncertainty
                          that accurately reflects how it feels in real life.</p>
