              <p class="lead mb-4">I got into reading through booktok in 2023 where I spent every waking moment of that entire year trying to read as many fantasy books as I possibly could. This was like re-discovering a childhood hobby
                but in the mature adult form in the most satisfying way possible. From reading series Harry Potter, Twilight, The Hunger Games, and others, these modern fantasies have introduced me to badass female characters one after another,
                romances that make me feel like a teenage girl again, and epic world-building that give me that Marvel End-game feeling and there's something satisfying about how all these worlds and characters are built and exist in my head.
                I also just love how fantasy books allow for endless creativity in building worlds with parallels to the real world to shed light or angle a certain topics in a way that's hard to illustrate in the real world. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">The Green Bone Saga an urban fantasy taken place in a world where Jade is a stone that can give its weilder special powers and it's largely controlled by clans, the main two being the No Peak clan
                          and the Mountain Clan. We follow the Kaul family who are leaders of the No Peak clan as they deal with political conflicts with the Mountain Clan over Jade distribution. The magic system with Jade is actually
                          pretty incredibly designed without any noticeable plot holes and lots power limitations that make the fights suspenseful be there's no character who's too OP so anything can happen. You really get immersed into
                          this world's cultures, customs, religion and politics. If you don't like plots with politics, you probably won't like this but I still found the books very entertaining even with the more slow-burn style of action.
                          <br><br>
                          This was the first series I read back in Jan and it threw me into this whole world of modern adult fantasy. I think the main thing I loved about this series is how well the characters were written.
                          They actually felt like real people and I grew to care about them like my own family. I literally bawled my eyes out and grieved with the characters whenever someone died. I remember there was a surprise attack
                          on one of my fav characters and I didn't know if they would survive and when they did I literally burst into tears of relief. The story takes place across a span of 40 ish years so you really watch the characters
                          grow up and the ending just felt so surreal like you lived through those years with them.  It also just made me think pretty heavily
                          about the differences between a collectivity vs individualistic culture, especially having grown up in an individualistic culture and heavily leaning towards it, the comradarie and sense of duty in the family in this book made me
                          really see the pros of a more collectivistic culture. To this day I still think about the Kaul family every day I love them so much.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">The Poppy War trilogy is a historical/war fantasy that follows this orphan named Fang Runin (Rin) as she ascends from poverty into the top military school and finds out that she is a shaman and can
                        summon the phoenix god's fire powers. Her country, Nikan, has been in constant war from a colonizing force named the Federation of Mugen and she learns to use her shaman fire powers to fight as her country yet
                        again comes under attack. I believe this story is heavily inspired by the second Sino-Japanese war as the Federation is a parallel to Japan and Nikan is a parallel to China. Rin's character arc was also inspired by Mao Zedong
                        <br><br>
                        I read this series back in February 2023 and I have not been able to shut up about it. If I had one word to describe it, it would be devastation. This was a very dark read and it def made me really depressed thinking about the
                        atrocities that the events in this book was inspired by but it def got me to be interested in learning more about Chinese history and imperialism. Tbh the plot is just depression on depression. Whenever you think the situation
                        can't get any worse, it does. Rin is the most UNHINGED main character I've ever read like she rivals Eren Jeager on the unhinged spectrum. I will never forget in the beginning of the first book, she gets her first period and
                        she decides that periods are too inconvenient for her studies so she just casually REMOVES HER UTERUS. The magic system was a little confusing bc it was largely based in religion (which is its own interesting topic in this book).
                        And this series had the literal worst betrayal l've ever witnessed. I didn't even see it coming and it was gut-wrenchingly painful and tragic.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Mistborn (Era 1) trilogy by Brandon Sanderson is a heist/epic fantasy with a very unique, but well-designed magic system, intriguing world-building, a loveable, hilarious found family, anime-style fight scenes,
                          and an absolute badass female main character. This is the only series so far that has made me actually laugh out loud, cry on an airplane, and white-man-watching-football-style fist pump. It's my first introduction into
                          Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe and his work in general and if I'm already having this much fun, l'm very excited for what's to come as I dive into the rest of the Cosmere. This series has hands down the best world-building
                          I've seen in a fantasy series so far and I'm well aware this isn't even his best work. Reading these kinds of epic build-up fantasies, I always try to predict what the story is building up to, but I can confidently say that I predicted
                          absolutely nothing in this series, the twists actually threw me off guard but made so much sense in hindsight.
                          <br><br>
                          Vin is honestly possibly my favorite fmc so far. Her fight scenes were literally Levi Ackerman-next level shit like this very petite woman was getting strangled by a humongous macho man and she proceeded to combine her powers strategically
                          to behead the man WITH HER FOREHEAD. And that's just one of the MANY absolute savage anime shit she pulls off. Her romance with Elend was so vanilla and simple in the best way like their entire relationship was so purely based on absolute
                          trust in each other and nothing else and I ate that shit up??? ELEND IS SUCH A GOOD BOY Also I stan Sazed so hard, he felt like an wise older brother I never had and his character arc with his crisis in faith was so interesting to follow
                          and his ending was absolute batshit.</p>

                          the development of these magic silver rods that uses implicit meanings lost in translation between 2-4 languages to emit magical properties that are used in everyday society. I know that magic system sounded complicated but it was
                          actually really fascinating and educational to learn about the history of translations between different languages. He's in a group of 4 other minorities in his cohort as they experience the racism and treatment that comes with
                          each of their identities. Overall, this story explores the idea that languages and translation was used as a tool for colonialism to further oppress and exploit non-Eurocentric cultures. The magic system was more of a literary
                          device to have a tangible object to further demonstrate this argument. This was a very incredible educational and thought-provoking read, I ate up every word and I feel like I learned a
                          whole new frame of thinking about our history and colonialism. You can really tell while reading this book just how much research went into writing it and I cannot respect it enough.</p>

                        <p class="card-text"> The Broken Earth trilogy is a science fantasy that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where Earth has these catastrophic seismic events called "Fifth Seasons" that cause mass migrations/destruction every
                          few decades or so and humanity has learned to function under these fifth seasons. There's a "race" of people called Orogenes who are born with a special ability to control the earth to an extent and they're basically trained
                          to minimize these fifth seasons, but because they can also be dangerous if they don't learn to control their power, society has ostracized/demonized them and they are seen as a danger that needs to be regulated and their powers
                          are exploited. The story follows a mother (Essun) who is an orogene searching for her daughter (Nassun) who has been kidnapped by her father after he found out his kids were orogenes and he killed his own son and abducted his daughter.
                          <br><br>
                          This series was an absolute masterpiece. It explores the concept of oppression in a way l've never thought about before and illustrates it in the story so creatively. Essun is an absolute badass of a woman who casually accidentally
                          wipes out entire cities when she's in a pinch. Nassun has a very complicated relationship with her mother and she goes on her own power-up journey where she ends up on the opposite moral conclusion as her mom when they finally reunite
                          and they have this epic confrontation as a result of their estranged relationship and seperate journeys. I will say, the writing style and world building are pretty hard to follow in the beginning. The first book is written with
                          3 perspectives and one of the perspectives is in second person. It gets explained later who exactly is "narrating" the story and it all makes sense in the end but it took me a while to catch on.</p>

                          and the best part was just seeing how much of a green forest Rhysand was in just empowering and supporting Feyre in becoming the badass she eventually steps into. He's an example of the kind of healthy, stable love that girls yearn for
                          as they get older. He is so powerful himself  and truly respects Feyre as an equal which is so hard to find in romances. He had me kicking my feet and giggling and gave me all the butterflies.

                          I'm also a huge stan of Nesta which is apparently a controversial stance in the fandom, but I relate to her a lot as the oldest sibling who has had to fight through dabilitating self hatred to then watch her younger siblings become
                          so well adjusted and unrelatable and how isolating that feels. Watching her journey felt so personal because it showed a very imperfect, non-linear process of her making mistakes but being able to see her inner struggles allowed me to empathize
                          with her more and made it that much more satisfying when she ultimately picks herself back up and finds her girl group and strength in herself.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Throne of Glass is a YA epic fantasy with like witches, demons, wyverns, kingdoms, faes, etc. It follows Celaena Sardothian, a legendary assassin who's imprisoned as a slave after getting betrayed as she gets
                          the opportunity to compete to become the King's personal assassin. But there's some kind of dark force at play that surrounds this King and you basically follow her uncover her past while uncovering the evil that's been plaguing her
                          entire realm. Along the way, she is forced to face her past and come to terms with the responsibility of the role she was born into to defend. You basically follow multiple character's storylines and watch them all converge in the end
                          in the most epic way.

                          I have a love hate relationship with this series. The first 3 books were pretty slow but after I got to the 4th book I was pretty hooked bc that's when I started getting really invested in the characters and the plot. Sarah J Maas is
                          really good at writing very likeable characters that you just have no choice but to root for. I wasn't a fan of most of the romance in this series, mostly because there was a lot of unnecessary romance plots that didn't need to happen,
                          especially in the first two books. But there were just so many epic moments that I think made this series worth it for me to experience. Many of the character arcs had very good build-ups and emotional conclusions that you have no
                          choice but to walk away from the series feeling a sense of emptiness.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">A normal pink-haired human girl, Evangeline seeks out the prince of hearts, Jacks to heal her broken heart but instead the chain events takes her to the northern region where she reunites with the prince of hearts and realizes
                          that she's a part of a prophecy in that region to collect 4 stones to open a mysterious gate. Jacks is essentially using her to open the gate for his own secret motive. Because this prophecy is tied to some mysterious danger,
                          there are many people who try to interfere by killing Evangeline, which forces Jacks to constantly come to her rescue. This is a very whimsical, fairytale-esque fantasy for the delusional girlies who fall for the guy who's an asshole
                          the entire series until one moment where it's revealed that he actually cared the whole time and was mean to her to protect her. These are the types of stories I grew up with and I've had to learn to un-internalize, but if I turn my
                          critical thinking off for reading this series, the slow-burn build-up into that moment just hits like nothing else. I have moments and quotes from this series that replay in my head over and over and never fail to make me giggle and kick
                          my feet in the most delusional way. It's definitely not for everyone, but when it hits, it hits.</p>
