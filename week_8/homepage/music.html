              <p class="lead mb-4">I would describe music taste as spanning multiple genres, but very concentrated in certain artists within each genre. Every now and then I'll go through a phase with a genre and have a few select artists
                I like and stick to those artists. When the phase fades, I usually keep the one artist on my radar and go deep into their entire discrography until I know every single one of their songs. My phases so far has spanned into pop,
                indie soft pop, kpop, show tunes, EDM, and recently hip-hop. In general, I am a lyric girlie so I gravitate towards songs that describe in their lyrics experiences that directly relate to what I'm experiencing in a given period
                of my life. Often times, I have certain songs that I can pinpoint with an era of my life based on how much I resonated with it at the time and it's nice to have these associations to be able to look back on those memories.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Not a surprise to anyone, but I'm a die hard Swiftie. She's been my very first artist I became a fan of since 6th grade and I followed her all the way until Reputation when I dropped off. It was until
                          Red (Taylor's Version) came out with the All Too Well 10 minute version that got me sucked back in and I went full send on her entire discography. My favorite album is between Folklore and The Tortured Poets Department.
                          Fun fact: TTPD came out on my birthday 2 months after I got my heart completely shattered and the fact that it ended up being a double album made it the most perfect gift at the most perfect time so of course I'm going
                          to be pretty biased towards it. What I've always loved about Taylor Swift is her mastery of story-telling through her lyrics and capturing such specific emotions in the details of her stories or through extended metaphors like
                          how she describes someone lovebombing, she writes "A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme" or comparing the healing of a breakup to the withdrawal of a drug when she writes "10 months sober
                          I won't give in / Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it." Bottom line is, any emotion that I'm feeling at any given moment, I can usually find a Taylor Swift song to apply. Her music makes me feel so seen.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">I became a fan of Seventeen in 2019. At first I just loved the positive, uplifting nature of their music but as I watched more and more content about the group of boys, I really fell in love with their dynamic as a group,
                        bonds with each other, and their individual personalities. They are a wholesome group of boys who have a very chaotic energy to them but work together as one whole unit. They're the living definition of true "synergy". What sets them
                        apart from most other kpop groups is that their members write, produce, and choreograph their entire discography. They take a lot of creative agency in their art and it shows in the messages that they share in their music and the authentic
                        energy they bring on stage. My favorite member is the main vocalist, Dokyeom aka DK. His voice is hands down the best, most versatile male vocal skill I've ever heard. It's always shocking to me how much control he has over it at such a
                        young age and it shows just the sheer amount of hours and hard work he's put into it to be able to sing so effortlessly live. He's also the most chaotic member in the group and has just pure entertainer energy, constantly making everyone
                        laugh. When you see him live, you can see just how passionate he is about being on stage and it's such a wholesome energy to witness. And by all accounts of the members, he's also just a kind person who is so affectionate to everyone
                        and gets very emotional in the most endearing ways. In many ways, Seventeen has been my source of comfort through some formative years of my life so I'll always be grateful towards them for getting me through that time of my life.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I've been a fan of IU since middle school. What sets her apart is her sheer vocal talent. Her voice is so unique and powerful and seeing how her music has evolved over a decade has just been astounding. Her music has matured
                          with her, but she somehow always finds a way to come out with a sound that is so unique to her and captures the visuals of the song so perfectly. Her music is truly timeless, even the songs from a decade ago are still amazing songs to
                          listen to now and she just keeps getting better. She's an artist that I can see is so passionate about the actual craft of music and it shows in the quality of work she consistently puts out. I got to see her live this past year and
                          her live vocals were no joke, a testiment to over a decade of relentless vocal training. She's someone you can sit back and just listen to her sing for hours with minimal visual, choreo, set effects because her raw voice stonds on its own.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I had an EDM phase back in 2019 where I enjoyed listening to more melodic, emotional type of EDM and Dabin was one of the artists that I really enjoyed seeing live. I have since dropped off of EDM in general, but I will still
                          try to see Dabin as much as I can. I've probably seen him live over 10+ times and I'm still not tired of it. I love his style of just beautiful melodies with emotional lyrics as he builds into these extremely euphoric moments in his live sets.
                          I also just love his overal visuals for all his albums, merch, and set. He works with independent artists to release his music with those intricate works of art as album covers. With today's contemporary style, I see a lot of more simplistic,
                          sleek type designs, so I really appreciate when an artist goes the more detailed route and produces these unique visual works of art. I feel like I've watched him grow as an artist over the years -- when I first discovered him in 2019, he was
                          opening for Illenium and his fan base was relatively small but he's now grown to a size where he can host his own music festival, it's so satisfying to just see someone grow and get the recoognition they deserve over the years while his music
                          still stays true to quality I originally liked him for.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I've always loved musicals and watching live theatre productions because of the sheer vocal talent. Living in downtown Chicago, I got the opportunity to go see many broadway musicals live like Hamilton, Wicked, Dear Evan Hansen,
                          Rent, Six!, Hairspray, Frozen, The Lion King, Anastasia, Les Miserables, Hadestown, and Chicago. Every single show was a mind-blowing experience with the stage production, live vocal numbers, and story-telling. These songs end up becoming my
                          go-to shower or karaoke songs where I pretend like I can belt showstopper numbers like Defying Gravity. I recommend to anyone to experience live Broadway shows given the opportunity, it's a live experience that has left my jaw dropped on
                          multiple occasions.</p>

                          in general so I'm mostly just focusing on Kendrick's music but I'm finding myself enjoying hip-hop much more these days. Couple months ago in August, I experienced a very rage-invoking life event and for the entire month of September, I started
                          my every morning with Euphoria because it was a song that captured the pure rage I was feeling at the time and that was therapeautic for me. Overall, I'm enjoying Kendrick's discography more and more as I dive deeper into it and I can see why
                          he's such a huge, respected artist.</p>
